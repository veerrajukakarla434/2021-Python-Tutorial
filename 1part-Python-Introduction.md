* Python is a general purpose, dynamic, high-level, and interpreted programming language. 
*  It supports Object Oriented programming approach to develop applications. It is simple and easy to learn and provides lots of high-level data structures.
* Python is easy to learn yet powerful and versatile scripting language, which makes it attractive for Application Development.
* Python's syntax and dynamic typing with its interpreted nature make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development.
* Python supports multiple programming pattern, including object-oriented, imperative, and functional or procedural programming styles.
* Python is not intended to work in a particular area, such as web programming. That is why it is known as multipurpose programming language because it can be used with web, enterprise, 3D CAD, etc.
* We don't need to use data types to declare variable because it is dynamically typed so we can write a=10 to assign an integer value in an integer variable.
* Python makes the development and debugging fast because there is no compilation step included in Python development, and edit-test-debug cycle is very fast.

#### Why learn Python?
* Python provides many useful features to the programmer. These features make it most popular and widely used language. We have listed below few-essential feature of Python.
* Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).
* Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.
* Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.
* Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.
* Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.

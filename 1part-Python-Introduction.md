# Python Tutorial
* Python tutorial is designed for beginners and professionals.
* Python is a simple, general purpose, high level, and object-oriented programming language.
* Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.

* Python is a general purpose, dynamic, high-level, and interpreted programming language. 
*  It supports Object Oriented programming approach to develop applications. It is simple and easy to learn and provides lots of high-level data structures.
* Python is easy to learn yet powerful and versatile scripting language, which makes it attractive for Application Development.
* Python's syntax and dynamic typing with its interpreted nature make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development.
* Python supports multiple programming pattern, including object-oriented, imperative, and functional or procedural programming styles.
* Python is not intended to work in a particular area, such as web programming. That is why it is known as multipurpose programming language because it can be used with web, enterprise, 3D CAD, etc.
* We don't need to use data types to declare variable because it is dynamically typed so we can write a=10 to assign an integer value in an integer variable.
* Python makes the development and debugging fast because there is no compilation step included in Python development, and edit-test-debug cycle is very fast.

#### Why learn Python?
* Python provides many useful features to the programmer. These features make it most popular and widely used language. We have listed below few-essential feature of Python.
* Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).
* Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.
* Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.
* Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.
* Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.
 
  * **Easy to use and Learn**
     * Python is easy to learn as compared to other programming languages. Its syntax is straightforward and much the same as the English language. There is no use of the semicolon or curly-bracket, the indentation defines the code block. It is the recommended programming language for beginners.
  * **Expressive Language**
     * Python can perform complex tasks using a few lines of code. A simple example, the hello world program you simply type print("Hello World"). It will take only one line to execute, while Java or C takes multiple lines.
  * **Interpreted Language**
     * Python is an interpreted language; it means the Python program is executed one line at a time. The advantage of being interpreted language, it makes debugging easy and portable.
  * **Cross-platform Language**
     * Python can run equally on different platforms such as Windows, Linux, UNIX, and Macintosh, etc. So, we can say that Python is a portable language. It enables programmers to develop the software for several competing platforms by writing a program only once.
  * **Object-Oriented Language**
    * Python supports object-oriented language and concepts of classes and objects come into existence. It supports inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation, etc. The object-oriented procedure helps to programmer to write reusable code and develop applications in less code. 
  * **Open Source Language**
    * Python supports object-oriented language and concepts of classes and objects come into existence. It supports inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation, etc. The object-oriented procedure helps to programmer to write reusable code and develop applications in less code.
  * **Extensible**
  *  **Learn Standard Library**
     * It provides a vast range of libraries for the various fields such as machine learning, web developer, and also for the scripting. There are various machine learning libraries, such as Tensor flow, Pandas, Numpy, Keras, and Pytorch, etc. Django, flask, pyramids are the popular framework for Python web development.
     
  * GUI Programming Support
  * Integrated
  * **Embeddable**
    * The code of the other programming language can use in the Python source code. We can use Python source code in another programming language as well. It can embed other language into our code.
    
  * **Dynamic Memory Allocation**
    * In Python, we don't need to specify the data-type of the variable. When we assign some value to the variable, it automatically allocates the memory to the variable at run time. Suppose we are assigned integer value 15 to x, then we don't need to write int x = 15. Just write x = 15.
    
  * Wide Range of Libraries and Frameworks  OR Explore Libraries and Frameworks
    * Python consists of vast libraries and various frameworks. After getting familiar with Python's basic concepts, the next step is to explore the Python libraries. Libraries are essential to work with the domain specific projects. In the following section, we describe the brief introduction of the main libraries.
        * TensorFlow - It is an artificial intelligence library which allows us to create large scale AI based projects.
        * Django - It is an open source framework that allows us to develop web applications. It is easy, flexible, and simple to manage.
        * Flask - It is also an open source web framework. It is used to develop lightweight web applications.
        * Pandas - It is a Python library which is used to perform scientific computations.
        * Keras - It is an open source library, which is used to work around the neural network.
  
#### Where is Python used?  
* Python is a general-purpose, popular programming language and it is used in almost every technical field. The various areas of Python use are given below.

  * Data Science
  * Date Mining
  * Desktop Applications
  * Console-based Applications
  * Mobile Applications
  * Software Development
